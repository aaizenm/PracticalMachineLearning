## Backgrownd

For this assignment, I build a predictive model to determine whether a particular form of exercise (barbell lifting) 
is performed correctly, using accelerometer data.

## Loading of the packages
The first part is the declaration of the package which will be used. 

Note : to be reproductible, I also set the seed value.

```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(Hmisc)

set.seed(4356)
```
