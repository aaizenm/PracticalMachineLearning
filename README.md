Data Processing and Analysis

The training and testing datasets used in the analysis may be found as follows:

Training dataset:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

Testing dataset:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

We begin by loading the required libraries and reading in the training and testing datasets, assigning missing values to entries that are currently 'NA' or blank.
